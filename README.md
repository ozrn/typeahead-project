# JS30 #6: typeahead-project
This is a JavaScript practice, one of the JavaScript30 challenges by Wes Bos.<br><br>
### General Info
This project intends to display how to fetch data from an external source and filter the ones that we've searched for. Once we get the data by fetching from the source,
whenever someone types into the search box, it's going to filter the array down to a subset of all the ones that either the city name or state name will match and show everything that matches the word searched for.
